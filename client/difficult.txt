This assignment is difficult. The rest of this text file is meant to continue on and on for what seems like forever so that I can assure that the server will read all the parts of this file until completion so that it can read any file of variable lengths and upload it correctly because at some point there could be a test where the file trying to be uploaded will be super large. You know what's also difficult is the fact that not only is this assignment going on which would take me more than the week and a half given to perfect but we also have a test. That's always fun. I think this class is interesting but this is probably the most difficult class thus far. Is that weird? Probably. I don't know I have mixed feelings on the whole thing. Anyway I love having this discussion with myself because I have to fill up this file with a bunch of text so it can be copied correctly. I'm going to copy all of this and copy it again just to be sure. This assignment is difficult.
